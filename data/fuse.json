(e.g. DB read/write ratio, concurrent connections, bandwidth usage, whale users, etc.)\n\ne.g. Twitter home page. \n- A user can follow many people. When user goes to home page, fetch all recent tweets of followees from DB. Problem: DB reads expensive.\n- Solution: cache a user's home page. When followee tweets, update followers' caches. Problem: Celebrities have many followers. Tweets are expensive as they need to update millions of cache entries.\n- Solution: Use both. Don't update cache for whale followees. If user follows a whale user, fetch from DB to get update from them.\n\n## Describing Performance\n\n","n":0.088}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Reliability","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- A system is considered _reliable_ when it performs to specifications with acceptable performance. It continues to function correctly in face of different types of errors that could occur (e.g. human, software, hardware)\n- We differentiate between _faults_ and _failures_. Faults are when the system stops performing to specifications. Failures occur when system stops providing a service to its users.\n- It's impossible to design a system that's 100% fault-tolerant or resilient (e.g. can't protect system against natural disasters)\n\n## Hardware Errors\n\n- Redundancy of a single machine's components used to be enough to gaurantee high availability (disks, batteries, etc.)\n- Nowadays we move towards redundancy in number of machines as well (e.g. AWS prioritizes elasticity and flexibility over hardware reliability of a single machine)\n- Advantages of machine redundancy: deploy/update without taking down whole system\n\n## Software Errors\n\n- Usually related bugs where an assumption is made about the system's environment which was usually true until it wasn't\n- Can do little to prevent other than monitoring, thinking through assumptions and testing (e.g. chaos monkey)\n\n## Human Errors\n\n- Humans unreliable, most outages are caused by operator error\n- Ways to prevent:\n  - Introduce processes to make it difficult to make mistakes\n  - Sandbox environments for devs to test with real data\n  - Testing: Manual, unit, integration\n  - Monitoring/telemetry allow us to see how a system is functioning and detect errors before they get out of hand","n":0.067}}}]}
